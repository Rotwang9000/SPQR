## Task: Debug and Fix SPQR Decoder Issues

### Problem Identified
The SPQR decoder was stopping execution after grid estimation, with logs ending abruptly after `"Estimated grid: 21√ó21, 6px/module"`. No error messages were appearing in the console, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.

### Root Cause Hypothesis
Likely causes:
1. Silent exception being swallowed somewhere
2. JavaScript syntax error preventing code execution
3. Browser caching preventing updated code from loading
4. Execution path issue in conditional logic

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
Added comprehensive try-catch blocks to capture and log all exceptions:

**File:** `docs/app.js`
- `detectSPQR()` function (lines 1806-1912):
  - Wrapped entire color detection section in try-catch
  - Added explicit error logging with stack traces
  - Re-throw errors to ensure visibility in console

- `handleFileUpload()` function (lines 1682-1696):
  - Wrapped `detectSPQR()` call in try-catch
  - Added before/after logging
  - Display error messages in UI

#### 2. Improved Logging
Added detailed console.log statements at every major step:
- Before/after grid hint processing
- Before/after color detection
- Before returning results
- At success/failure points

#### 3. Version Management
Updated cache-busting version from `v=20251026h` to `v=20251028a` to force browser refresh.

#### 4. Testing Tools Created
Created `docs/test-upload.html`:
- Standalone test page for debugging
- Generate test codes inline
- Upload and test decoding
- Real-time console output display
- No need for full app environment

### Files Modified

1. **docs/app.js**
   - Added try-catch blocks around critical sections
   - Enhanced logging throughout
   - Improved error reporting

2. **docs/index.html**
   - Updated version parameter

3. **CURRENT_STATUS.md**
   - Updated date and progress
   - Documented changes
   - Updated testing instructions

4. **README.md**
   - Added decoder testing section
   - Documented test-upload.html

### Files Created

1. **docs/test-upload.html**
   - Complete test harness for decoder
   - Self-contained with console output

2. **CHANGES_20251028.md**
   - Detailed change log
   - Testing instructions
   - Expected behaviour documentation

3. **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Overview of session work

### Testing Instructions

#### Quick Test
1. Open `docs/test-upload.html` in browser
2. Generate a test QR code
3. Download it
4. Upload it back
5. Check console output section

#### Full Test
1. Open `docs/index.html` with fresh cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open browser Developer Console (F12)
3. Generate CMYRGB QR with text "SPQR"
4. Save the generated image
5. Upload it via file input
6. Check console for detailed logs

### Expected Outcomes

#### If Working Correctly:
Console should show:
```
SPQR detection starting: 174x174 image
  Color ratio: 0.XXX
  Estimated grid: 21√ó21, 6px/module
  hasGridHint=false, proceeding to color detection...
  After hasGridHint block, about to sample TL finder center...
  Sampling TL finder center for color detection...
  Finder center has X distinct colors
CMYRGB (8-color, 3-layer) SPQR detected
üîç SPQR 8-colour (CMYRGB) decoder starting...
‚úÖ SPQR detection succeeded
```

#### If Error Occurs:
Console should show:
```
‚ùå detectSPQR error: [Error message]
Stack trace: [Stack trace]
```

This will identify the exact line and function where the error occurs.

### Next Steps for User

1. **Test with fresh browser cache**
   - Use Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
   - Or open in incognito/private window

2. **Check console output**
   - Look for the new log messages
   - Check if execution completes or where it stops
   - Note any error messages

3. **Report findings**
   - If working: Great! Test with degraded images next
   - If still failing: Share console output
   - If new error appears: We now have exact error location

### Verification Checklist

- [x] Enhanced error handling in `detectSPQR()`
- [x] Enhanced error handling in `handleFileUpload()`
- [x] Added comprehensive logging
- [x] Updated version number
- [x] Created test page
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] No syntax errors (verified with read_lints)
- [ ] **Testing required** (user to perform)

### Technical Details

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```javascript
try {
    // Critical code
    console.log('Step X...');
    const result = riskyOperation();
    console.log('Step X completed');
    return result;
} catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Error at step X:', error);
    console.error('Stack:', error.stack);
    throw error; // Re-throw for visibility
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches all exceptions
- Logs errors with context
- Provides stack traces
- Doesn't hide errors
- Makes debugging much easier

### Known Limitations

1. Still requires browser testing to confirm fix
2. May reveal new underlying issues
3. Degraded image decoding may need separate fixes
4. Parity recovery may need additional work

### Success Criteria

**Minimum Success:**
- Error messages now visible in console
- Execution path is traceable
- Can identify exact failure point

**Full Success:**
- Clean CMYRGB codes decode successfully
- Round-trip encode/decode works
- Ready to tackle degraded image decoding

### Time Invested

- Code analysis: ~15 minutes
- Implementation: ~20 minutes
- Documentation: ~15 minutes
- **Total: ~50 minutes**

### Code Quality

- ‚úÖ No syntax errors
- ‚úÖ Consistent code style
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Good logging practices
- ‚úÖ Well-documented changes
- ‚úÖ Test tools provided

---

## Summary

Enhanced the SPQR decoder with comprehensive error handling and logging to diagnose why execution was stopping after grid estimation. Created testing tools and documentation to support ongoing debugging efforts. The changes ensure that any errors will be caught and logged with full context, making it much easier to identify and fix the underlying issue.

The decoder now has robust error handling throughout the critical path, from file upload through color detection to final decoding. All changes are documented, tested for syntax errors, and ready for user testing.

**Next action:** User should test with fresh browser cache and check console output to either confirm the fix works or identify the exact error that was being silenced.
