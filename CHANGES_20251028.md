# Changes Made - 2025-10-28

## Summary

Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities in the SPQR decoder to identify why decoding stops after grid estimation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `detectSPQR` Function (`docs/app.js`)

**Lines 1806-1912**: Wrapped the entire color detection section in a comprehensive try-catch block.

**Added:**
- Try-catch block around color detection and layer decoding logic
- Explicit error logging with stack traces
- Additional console.log statements to trace execution flow
- Error re-throwing to ensure errors are visible in browser console

**Purpose:**
- Catch any exceptions that might be stopping execution silently
- Provide detailed stack traces for debugging
- Log execution progress at every major step

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Handler (`docs/app.js`)

**Lines 1682-1696**: Added try-catch block around SPQR detection call in `handleFileUpload`.

**Added:**
- Console logging before/after SPQR detection
- Success/failure logging
- Error catching and reporting
- Display of error messages in the UI when detection fails

**Purpose:**
- Ensure errors in `detectSPQR` are caught and displayed
- Provide clear indication when detection succeeds vs. fails vs. errors

### 3. Version Update

**File:** `docs/index.html`
**Change:** Updated version from `v=20251026h` to `v=20251028a`

**Purpose:**
- Force browser cache refresh
- Ensure users get the latest code

### 4. Created Test Page

**File:** `docs/test-upload.html`

**Features:**
- Simple standalone test page
- Generate CMYRGB test codes
- Download and re-upload for testing
- Real-time console output display
- Clear step-by-step testing process

**Purpose:**
- Provide easy way to test decoder changes
- Visualise console output in the browser
- Test round-trip encoding/decoding

### 5. Updated Status Document

**File:** `CURRENT_STATUS.md`

**Updates:**
- Document latest changes
- Update testing instructions
- Clarify next steps
- Update date to 2025-10-28

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Using Test Page

1. Open `docs/test-upload.html` in a browser
2. Click "Generate CMYRGB QR" to create a test code
3. Click "Download PNG" to save it
4. Use the file input to upload the saved PNG
5. Check the console output section for detailed logs

### Method 2: Using Main App

1. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (ensure cache is cleared or use Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open browser Developer Console (F12)
3. Enter "SPQR" in the text box
4. Select "CMYRGB (8-color, 3-layer)" option
5. Click "Generate"
6. Right-click on the generated QR code and "Save image as..."
7. Use the file upload input to upload the saved image
8. Watch the console for detailed logging

### What to Look For

**Expected Behaviour (Success):**
```
SPQR detection starting: 174x174 image
  Color ratio: 0.XXX (XXX colored pixels)
  Estimated grid: 21√ó21, 6px/module
  hasGridHint=false, proceeding to color detection...
  After hasGridHint block, about to sample TL finder center...
  Sampling TL finder center for color detection...
  Finder center has X distinct colors (from 9 samples)
CMYRGB (8-color, 3-layer) SPQR detected
üîç SPQR 8-colour (CMYRGB) decoder starting: 174√ó174px
...
‚úÖ SPQR detection succeeded
```

**Expected Behaviour (Error):**
```
‚ùå detectSPQR error: [Error message]
Stack trace: [Stack trace]
```

**Unexpected Behaviour:**
If logs stop abruptly without an error message, this indicates:
- A browser-specific issue
- Code still being cached (try hard refresh)
- A different issue not yet identified

## Files Modified

1. `/home/rotwang/SPQR/docs/app.js` - Enhanced error handling
2. `/home/rotwang/SPQR/docs/index.html` - Version update
3. `/home/rotwang/SPQR/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Status update

## Files Created

1. `/home/rotwang/SPQR/docs/test-upload.html` - Test page
2. `/home/rotwang/SPQR/CHANGES_20251028.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. **Test the changes** using one of the methods above
2. **Analyse console output** to identify where execution stops or errors occur
3. **If still failing**, look for:
   - Specific error messages in console
   - Where execution stops (last log message)
   - Any browser security errors or warnings
4. **If successful**, proceed to test with degraded images (screenshots)
5. **Document findings** in CURRENT_STATUS.md

## Rollback Instructions

If these changes cause issues:

1. Revert `docs/app.js`:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 docs/app.js
   ```

2. Revert `docs/index.html` version:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 docs/index.html
   ```

Or use Git to check specific commit hashes if needed.

## Notes

- Error handling is now comprehensive throughout the detection chain
- All decoder functions (`detectSPQR`, `decodeCMYRGBLayers`, `decodeSPQRLayers`) have proper try-catch blocks
- Console logging is extensive to help trace execution flow
- Test page provides isolated environment for debugging

## Expected Impact

- **No change** in successful decoding behaviour
- **Much better** error reporting when decoding fails
- **Easier debugging** with comprehensive logs
- **No performance impact** (try-catch is negligible overhead)
